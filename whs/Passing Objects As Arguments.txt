Passing Objects As Arguments:
Objects of a class can be passed as arguments to functions in three ways:
1.Pass by Value
2.Pass by Reference
3.Pass by Pointer
The method you choose depends on whether you want to 
modify the original object, 
avoid copying the object, 
or simply use the object's value. 
1. Pass by Value
When an object is passed by value, a copy of the object is created, and any modifications made inside the function do not affect the original object.
e.g 
2. Pass by Reference
When an object is passed by reference, modifications inside the function affect the original object.
e.g
3. Pass by Pointer
When an object is passed by pointer, we pass the address of the object, and modifications affect the original object.
e.g
1.Use pass by reference (&) to avoid unnecessary copying and improve performance.
2.Use pass by pointer (*) when working with dynamically allocated objects.
3.Use pass by value when you want to keep the original object unchanged.
