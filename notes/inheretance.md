## Inheritance in C++

- Used to inherit or extend properties of existing classes into new classes.
- Reusability in application is possible only because of the inheritance feature.

types of inheritance:
1. Single level inheritance
2. Multi level inheritance
3. Multiple inheritance
4. Hibrid inheritance
5. Hierarchical inheritance

### important points
- to inherit existing class featurs into new class, we have atleast 1 new feature in new class.
- we always create instance of child class in inheritance.
- behavior of constructor and destructor in inheritance 
    1. constructor follows top to bottom order, first base class constructor is invoked and then child class.
    2. diestructor follows bottom to top order, first child class destructor is invoked and then base class.
