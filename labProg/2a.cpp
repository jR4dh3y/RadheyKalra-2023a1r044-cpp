/*
Exp 2(a) To allocate appropriate access specifiers to data memebers of student and course class along with justification in comments 
We decared member variables or attributes of class student and class course
like student name, student id, marks, percentage, course name, course id, course credit as private member to protect our data from
unauthorized access.
We declared member function like Display(), Grade(),Club Assignment(),Course_Information_Display(),Course Selection() of class Course and class Student as public to share information between different members of class.
We declared constructor and destructor of class course and class student as public because we cannot assign any other access specifier to them. 
In opps programming we prioritize data over functions and provide layers of security to member variables to protect information sotred inside member variables is not accessible by any unauthorizedÂ entity.
