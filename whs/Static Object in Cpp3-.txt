Static Object in Cpp:-
In Case of Normal Object created inside a function , 
first constructor of class invoked , then constructor initialize memory to member varaibles
and member function and finally desctructor of the class invoked.
If we recall this function , again the whole process executed in the same sequence.
Beacuse the life time of a normal object is depend upon a function call.

But in case of Static object of a class , the constructor of class invoked only once ,
the life time of static object is present througout the program , destructor is invoked
at the end of the program . This means static object remains in existence until 
program ends.
 Imp Point :-
1. A static object is created once and destroyed at the end of the program.
2. Static Object retains its state through out the function call.
3. If a static object is declared inside a function , then its scope is limited to the function
but the life of the object remain until program ends.
