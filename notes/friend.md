## friend class and friend function
1. Used to access private members of class.
2. In cpp, this is a provision to provide access of private data to non members of class. 
3. This helps in providing limited access or controlled access of data outside the class without declaring them as public.
4. if we implement concept of friend class and friend fn in a application, it implements tight coupling but in morden programing languages we avoid tight coupling and follow concept of loose coupling, other programing languages achives tight coupling if required by using programming patter or style. 

no other object orented programming language has this feature because of encapsulation, it voilates the concept of encapsulation.
