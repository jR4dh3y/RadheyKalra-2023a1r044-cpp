Static Members of class
Imp Points:-
1.Static Members belongs to the class rather than any object of class.
2. If we create multiple instances(objects ) of class , static members don't replicate in memory,
all instances of class will shared same memory location for static members.
(Only one copy of Static member exists in memory)
3. Static Members are declared inside the class but defined outside the class.
4. Declared with keyword static.
4. Access using class name or object name.
5. If we don't define or initialize static variable , it is automatically initialized with 0.
